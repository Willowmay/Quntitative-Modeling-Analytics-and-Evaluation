# Quntitative-Modeling-Audience-Analytics-and-Evaluation

Target: 

1. Developing a quantitative measure of audience engagement using real TV transactional data;
        
2. Isolating noisy factors;
        
3. Understand the relationship between independent variables;


Senario: 

XYZ collects TV viewing information from 22.6 million householdsÂ (HHs) in the US, spread across the entire country. From these HHs, which report every click of the remote, XYZ's TV Essentials product uses sophisticated algorithms to project out to every TV HH in the US. We are interested in many aspects of TV viewing behavior, including metrics that infer how "engaged" the viewers are.
